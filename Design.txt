Program Name:
Driving Cost

Program Description:
Driving is expensive! With your programming partner, 
write a program to 
    prompt a user for two doubles: 
        a car's mpg (miles per gallon)  
        the gas price per gallon as input, 
    
    output the gas cost for:
        20 miles, 
        75 miles, and 
        500 miles.

Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved by executing

cout << fixed << setprecision(2); 


Design:
A. INPUT
prompt a user for two doubles: 
    double miles_per_gallon = 0.0;
    double usd_per_gallon = 0.0;

B. OUTPUT
    double usd_per_20_miles = 0.0; 
    double usd_per_75_miles = 0.0; 
    double usd_per_500_miles = 0.0; 

C. CALCULATIONS
Describe calculations used by algorithms in step D.  
    20 miles, 
    75 miles, and 
    500 miles.

usd_per_20_miles = 20.0 / miles_per_gallon * usd_per_gallon;
usd_per_75_miles = 75.0 / miles_per_gallon * usd_per_gallon;
usd_per_500_miles = 500.0 / miles_per_gallon * usd_per_gallon;

D. LOGIC and ALGORITHMS
Design the logic of your program using pseudocode or flowcharts. 
Use conditionals, loops, functions or array constructs.
List the steps in transforming inputs into outputs. 

PROMPT "MILES PER GALLON: "
INPUT   miles_per_gallon

PROMPT "USD PER GALLON: "
INPUT   usd_per_gallon
